# AI Powered Finite Automata Editor & Simulator
AI Powered Finite Autometa Editor and Simulator | Design, visualize, and simulate Deterministic and Non-deterministic Finite Automata | Convert Regex to DFA and NFA | AI Assistant for Finite Automata


## Introduction
FA-Editor-AI is a web-based tool that allows users to design, visualize, and simulate both Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). It also provides the ability to convert regular expressions to DFA and NFA. Additionally, the tool includes an AI assistant that can help users with various tasks related to finite automata.

## Features
- Design and visualize DFA and NFA
- Simulate DFA and NFA
- Convert regular expressions to DFA and NFA
- AI assistant for finite automata
